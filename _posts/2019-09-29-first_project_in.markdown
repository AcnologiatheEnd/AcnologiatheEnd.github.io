To be completely honest, I was expecting my first project to be immensely difficult than it really was, like create your very own facebook or something. I'm not saying it was completely easy though. I struggled for a good week after the thing was due, contemplating all my life choices that I've made up till now. The hardest part of my CLI project was actually the setup. I first tried to develop using learn ide which I failed at miserably. Then I went on to create a virtual machine which from my knowledge, is a software used to run different operating systems other than windows; I can't imagine how that works so I won't waste any of my brain resource on it. After going through the setup of my virtual machine, which could have been easier, I was on to next roadblock, scraping. At the moment, my scraping skills are quite horrendous. Don't ever ask me to scrape for you or you'll end up with an empty array. After figuring out that my first website was too much for me, I moved on to something a little more on the easy side due to time constraints. Damn. Once I got to scraping the website, everything else didn't seem so bad. It took me quite some time but I'm finally wrapping up my first project. Always remember that there's a way; maybe.
