When I started modules like sqlite3 and and sinatra, I was worried I wasn't being exposed to ruby enough and I would slowly lose understanding of the fundamentals of ruby. That's when I started looking around for websites that would give me a daily challenge, or something of that sort, to keep improving my very little ruby knowledge. Alas! I found codewars.

They are quite a few websites that are respectable in terms of practicing languages. codewars is a little different from some of them. It sort of has its own points system and levels. It also has achievements which kind of makes it feel somewhat of a game, which it makes it a little more exciting to fool around with. In addition, codewars makes other answers available from other users to compare with yours. You can also follow users, create a clans, etc. 

Overall, I'm very satisfied with codewars supplementing my ruby knowledge and hope to find other websites like it. Maybe a website more leaning towards web dev side but I'm probably asking for too much. Anyway, I'd reccommend giving it a try to see if it's your thing or not.
