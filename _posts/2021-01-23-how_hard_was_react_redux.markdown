I was really expecting React to be substantially harder than working with vanilla javascript. It was quite the contrary. React actually solved many of my issues I was having with vanilla js. I wouldn't consider myself super smart and I thought it was fairly understandable. After learning React, you'll be able to understand more realistically how a real world application is built out.

How about Redux? Redux was a little more challenging but once you understand it's concepts and use case, you shouldn't have any major issues with it. Redux might not seem like a necessity for smaller applications, but it is for applications on larger scales.

Overall, React/Redux reduce workload and time, they aren't that tough to learn like say sql with it's unique syntax and I'm really enjoying it more so than vanilla javascript. My favorite module so far!
